Visualization of Solute Transport in 1D Free and Porous Media Flow

Version 2-0 is extended from the original version, published in the textbook: 

Holzbecher, Ekkehard. 2012. “Environmental Modeling – using MATLAB”, Springer Publ., Heidelberg (2nd ed.). doi:10.1007/978-3-642-22042-5

In addition to the original version 2.0 includes the following features:
- indication of physical units for time T and length L
- option to switch between 'instantaneous source' and 'constant inflow'
- improved numerical evaluation  
- save figure option
- improved colouring
- optimized appearance for MAC and WINDOWS

The project aims finally to perform the inverse task: automatic estimation of parameters for observed profiles and breakthrough curves.The user is supposed to enter these measured data, choose the parameters to be estimated (maximum 3 because of uniqueness concerns). The program then will compute best fit parameter values.
